LAWGPT (model2)
This repository contains a full-stack demo: a React frontend and a backend composed of:

Node.js/Express server (MongoDB storage, authentication)
Python/Flask service (semantic search, file processing, RAG prompt-building, model orchestration)
This README points you to the backend/README.md which has detailed setup/run instructions for the backend services.

Quick links:

Backend README: backend/README.md
Backend .env example: backend/.env.example
If you'd like, I can add a top-level run-all script to launch both dev servers automatically.
